        <p><h4>A freshly baked bowl of man's most delicious concoction.</h4></p>

        <p>The below recipe was rescued from the condemned cliff-side home of a shaved man
            who was too insane to properly explain what he'd written down.</p>
            <p>NOTE: A microfluvial scale is strongly recommended when measuring the beetle 
            enzymes, as excessive use can result in a dry, stodgy puddin.</p?>

            <ul>
                <li>2 cups milled Oat Flour</l1>
                <li>6 tbsp soft Butter</li>
                <li>2 eggs 
                <li>1 cup + 1 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tsp Vanilla Essence</li>
                <li>16 2/3 microfluvial units of fresh Beetle Enzyme</li>
                <li>3/4 cup Cocoa Powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp Baking Powder</li>
                <li>3/4 cup coconut sugar (or granulated sweetener of choice)</li>
                <li>Assorted crushed or whole beetle husks, to decorate.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set oven temperature to 350 degrees fahrenheit</li>
                    <li>Combine Oat Flour, Cocoa Powder and Baking Powder in a large bowl.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, cream together butter and sugar until combined.</li>
                    <li>Heat the Beetle Enzymes to at least 105 degrees Fahrenheit by holding the octave
                        regulator against the enzyme packaging for as long as necessary. 
                        <p>NOTE** Make sure to heat the enzymes to at least 105 degrees, or they will not properly 
                            coagulate during baking.</p></li>
                    <li>Add Beetle Enzymes to bowl with butter and sugar, and stir thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>Add eggs, Vanilla Essence, and Apple Cider Vinegar to the bowl with the butter, sugar and enzymes. Mix to combine.</li>
                    <li>Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredient bowl and mix just until barely combined, to prevent loss of air bubbles.</li>
                    <li>Pour into a deep earthen vessel, cover with lid, and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.</li>
                    <p>Serve Beetlecap Puddin hot from the oven.</p>
